n Exercise 1, is it the correct approach to do (in order):
1) Calculate sum of sales for 500 steps 
2) Simulate the 500 steps, for example, 100 times 
-> that is, repeat part 1) 100 times.
3) Calculate the average of all sales for these 100 simulations
4) Plot the histogram for all different simulations.

Kavya: That is the correct approach.

It will be seen that the starting mood will affect a lot.

1000 simulations is enough
